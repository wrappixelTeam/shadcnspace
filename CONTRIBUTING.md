- Make atomic PRs — one feature, one bug fix, or one documentation update per PR.
- Include comments for complex logic, especially in MCP server or AI workflows.
- Ensure components are accessible and follow best practices (ARIA, semantic HTML).
- Keep MCP server code modular for easy integration with new components or blocks.


## Code of Conduct

We aim to maintain a welcoming and respectful community. By contributing to this project, you agree to abide by the Code of Conduct


## Reporting Issues
Before opening a new issue, please first search for existing issues to avoid duplicates.
Provide detailed reports with as much context as possible, including steps to reproduce the issue, your environment, and any relevant logs or screenshots.

For hard-to-reproduce bugs, please include a minimal reproducible repository or detailed steps to recreate the issue.

## Fixing Existing Issues
Help us by fixing existing issues.
Avoid working on issues already assigned to others to prevent duplicate efforts.

If you're interested in working on an issue, please add a comment to request assignment before starting work. This helps maintainers track who's working on what and prevents duplication of effort.

Use the following commit message format for fixes: fix(<issue-subject>): #<issue_number> [description]. For eg. fix(avatar): #3 fix bg-color of default avatar

## Feature Requests
Please note that not all feature requests will be accepted, as some may not align with the vision or scope of the project. Don't take it personally if a request is rejected.

## Pull Requests
Pull requests should address an open issue that is assigned to you. If no issue exists, create one first. If an issue is not assigned to you, please request assignment in the comments before submitting a PR. This ensures we avoid duplicate efforts.

For minor changes like fixing typos, an issue is not required. Feel free to directly open a pull request.

For documentation fixes, including updates to the website, you can also submit a pull request without opening an issue first.

**Thank you for helping make shadcnspace better! Your contributions directly help developers ship faster and build high-quality UIs.**
