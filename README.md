## What’s Included

Shadcn Space provides a complete, system-level UI foundation built on shadcn/ui and Base UI.

### UI Components

Production-ready components designed for real application logic:

- Buttons, badges, alerts

All components follow consistent APIs, predictable behavior, and accessible defaults.

### UI Blocks

Composable blocks built from core components:

- Hero and feature sections
- Dashboard sections and widgets

Blocks are structured for reuse across pages and projects.

### Templates and Dashboard Layouts

Layouts designed for long-term use:

- Dashboards UI Kits
- Landing pages

Layouts are cohesive, extensible, and suitable for production systems.

## Installation and Quick Start

You can add components directly to the project and keep full ownership of the code.

### Using the CLI

Install components, blocks, or templates using a CLI-based workflow that integrates with existing shadcn/ui projects.

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add @shadcn-space/button
```

This command adds the component source code directly to the project. You can edit, extend, or restructure it as needed.

### Manual Usage

You can also copy components, blocks, or layouts directly from this repository.

- No build step required
- All code is transparent and editable
- Follows the docs.

This approach works well for teams that prefer manual control or selective adoption.

## Not a library — a component distribution

Following the core philosophy of shadcn, **Shadcn Space is not an “install-from-npm” UI library**.

Instead, it’s an **open-source distribution of components**:

- Copy the source code directly
- Modify styles and variants freely
- Adjust logic to fit your app
- ntegrate seamlessly with your existing stack

There are **no hidden abstractions or runtime dependencies**.  
The code is yours to own, adapt, and evolve.

This **open-code approach** gives you full confidence and flexibility — so your UI scales with your product, not against it.

## Why should I use Shadcn Space ?

Shadcn Space builds on the core philosophy of shadcn/ui while focusing on what teams often need next: **more ready-to-use variants, richer examples, and complete UI blocks**. It provides a growing collection of components, blocks, and layouts designed around real product use cases, helping developers move beyond primitives and assemble interfaces faster.

While preserving the copy-and-paste, open-code approach, Shadcn Space aims to offer a **more guided and practical experience**. By showcasing multiple variants, sensible defaults, and pre-built patterns, it reduces the cognitive load of starting from scratch — without taking away flexibility or control over the code.
