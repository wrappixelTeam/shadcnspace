## What’s Included

Shadcn Space provides a complete, system-level UI foundation built on shadcn/ui and Base UI.

### UI Components

Production-ready components designed for real application logic:

- Buttons, badges, alerts

All components follow consistent APIs, predictable behavior, and accessible defaults.

### UI Blocks

Composable blocks built from core components:

- Hero and feature sections
- Dashboard sections and widgets

Blocks are structured for reuse across pages and projects.

### Templates and Dashboard Layouts

Layouts designed for long-term use:

- Dashboards UI Kits
- Landing pages

Layouts are cohesive, extensible, and suitable for production systems.

## Installation and Quick Start

You can add components directly to the project and keep full ownership of the code.

### Using the CLI

Install components, blocks, or templates using a CLI-based workflow that integrates with existing shadcn/ui projects.

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add @shadcn-space/button
```

This command adds the component source code directly to the project. You can edit, extend, or restructure it as needed.

### Manual Usage

You can also copy components, blocks, or layouts directly from this repository.

- No build step required
- All code is transparent and editable
- Follows the docs.

This approach works well for teams that prefer manual control or selective adoption.

## Not a library — a component distribution

Following the core philosophy of shadcn, **shadcnspace is not an “install-from-npm” UI library**.

Instead, it’s an **open-source distribution of components**:

- Copy the source code directly
- Modify styles and variants freely
- Adjust logic to fit your app
- ntegrate seamlessly with your existing stack

There are **no hidden abstractions or runtime dependencies**.  
The code is yours to own, adapt, and evolve.

This **open-code approach** gives you full confidence and flexibility — so your UI scales with your product, not against it.

## Why should I use shadcnspace ?

shadcnspace builds on the core philosophy of shadcn/ui while focusing on what teams often need next: **more ready-to-use variants, richer examples, and complete UI blocks**. It provides a growing collection of components, blocks, and layouts designed around real product use cases, helping developers move beyond primitives and assemble interfaces faster.

While preserving the copy-and-paste, open-code approach, shadcnspace aims to offer a **more guided and practical experience**. By showcasing multiple variants, sensible defaults, and pre-built patterns, it reduces the cognitive load of starting from scratch — without taking away flexibility or control over the code.

## This is where shadcnspace shines

Shadcnspace is built for **real production use**, not just demos or isolated components. Every component, block, and layout follows **shadcn/ui conventions** and is grounded in **Base UI primitives**, ensuring predictable behavior, accessibility, and long-term maintainability.

- **Production-ready by default** – Components, blocks, and layouts are designed for real applications, not examples. Clean structure, sensible defaults, and scalable patterns come first.
- **Extraordinary design quality** – Clean layouts, balanced spacing, and consistent visual structure across all components, blocks, and templates.
- **System-first architecture** – Components, blocks, templates, and dashboards are designed to work together with shared structure and conventions.
- **Built on shadcn/ui + Base UI** – Base UI primitives provide robust interaction logic, accessibility, and predictable behavior.
- **100+ free components** – Tabs, Tooltip, Button, Accordion, Badge, Card, Calendar, Checkbox, Apple Dock, authentication flows, and more — all designed for real products.
- **51+ reusable UI blocks & layouts** – Pre-built sections for marketing pages, applications, and dashboards, optimized for reuse.
- **3+ templates & dashboard UI kits** – Cohesive layouts for SaaS products, admin panels, onboarding flows, and internal tools.
- **Tailwind CSS with CVA** – Utility-first styling with controlled variants using Class Variance Authority.
- **CLI-friendly workflow** – Add components and blocks using a shadcn-style CLI with full code ownership.
- **Motion support** – Framer Motion variants that enhance interaction without affecting structure or accessibility.
- **No runtime dependencies** – No wrappers, no hidden abstractions, no vendor lock-in. All code lives inside your project.
- **MCP Server support** – Integrate Shadcnspace with an MCP server to enable AI-assisted workflows, component discovery, and automation.
